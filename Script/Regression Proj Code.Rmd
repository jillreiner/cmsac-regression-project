```{r}

cfb[is.na(cfb$excitement_index),]

cfb<- cfb[-c(268,625),]

cfb$home_1sthalf <- cfb$home_1_pts + cfb$home_2_pts 
cfb$home_2ndhalf <- cfb$home_3_pts + cfb$home_4_pts

cfb$away_1sthalf <- cfb$away_1_pts + cfb$away_2_pts
cfb$away_2ndhalf <- cfb$away_3_pts + cfb$away_4_pts

cfb$margin_1sthalf <- cfb$home_1sthalf - cfb$away_1sthalf
cfb$margin_game <- cfb$home_points - cfb$away_points

cfb$comeback <- (cfb$margin_game / cfb$margin_1sthalf) < 0
```

```{r}
cfb_ei %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = excitement_index)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
cfb_ei %>%
  group_by(conference_game) %>%
  summarize(avg_ei = mean(excitement_index)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = conference_game, y = avg_ei)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
cfb_ei %>%
  mutate(totalpoints = away_4_pts + home_4_pts + away_3_pts + home_3_pts + away_2_pts + home_2_pts + away_1_pts + home_1_pts) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = excitement_index, y = totalpoints)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth() +
  theme_bw()
```

Not very good. Total points could either be a complete blowout (not very exciting) or a close high scoring game (exciting).

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(data = cfb, excitement_index ~ comeback + margin_1sthalf +
                                        (conference_game * margin_1sthalf))
summary(lm1)
```
